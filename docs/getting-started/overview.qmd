The idea behind `fave-recode` is that no matter how much you may adjust the dictionary of a forced-aligner, you may still want to make programmatic changes to the output.

## Installation

You can install `fave-recode` at your system's command line with `pip`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| filename: terminal
pip install fave-recode
```

## Basic usage

Installation of the `fave-recode` python package makes the `fave_recode` executable, which can also be run at the command line. You can get help with `--help`

```{bash}
#| filename: terminal
fave_recode --help
```

To recode a single file, you need to provide `fave_recode` with, minimally, the input file (the `-i` flag), and the recoding scheme (with the `-s` flag). There are a few default recoding schemes that come with `fave_recode`.

```{bash}
#| filename: terminal
ls data
```

```{bash}
#| filename: terminal
fave_recode -i data/josef-fruehwald_speaker.TextGrid -s cmu2phila
ls data
```


```{bash}
#| echo: false
rm data/josef-fruehwald_speaker_recoded.TextGrid
```
