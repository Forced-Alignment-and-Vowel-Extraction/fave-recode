## Single Rule Application

A single rule will only apply if **all** of its conditions return `true`.

## Ruleset Application

Rules in a ruleset are applied in sequence, and once a rule applies to an interval, no other rules can apply. 

:::{.callout-important}
This means you *must* place more specific rules towards the top of your ruleset.
:::

For example, if you wanted every word with `AE1` followed by `N` to go into one category, *unless* it's the word `ran`, you would need to place the rule about `ran` into its own rule *before* the more general rule.

```yaml
- rule: ran-rule
  conditions:
    - attribute: inword.label
      relation: ==
      set: ran
  return: ae1
- rule: aen-rule 
  conditions:
    - attribute: label
      relation: ==
      set: AE1
    - attribute: fol.label
      relation: ==
      set: 'N'  
  return: ae2
```
